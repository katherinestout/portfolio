      <h1>Get to know me:</h1>
    <p>In 2017 I graduated from Hood College, 
        with a degree in Communications and a Minor in Studio Art.
        During my college years, I discovered two of my greatest passions;
        photography and coding. From 2016 - present I have ran my own photography 
        business.

        While I have dappled in coding for a few years, I finally took the plunge to 
        advance my career in 2018 when I earned my Full Stack Certificate from 
        George Washington University.
